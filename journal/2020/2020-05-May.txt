I experimented with remote control of brickpi3 by means of 
a python socket server running on the brickpi3. 
See the python/socketserver directory. There are two versions.
As it turns out, in Python, eval() can evaluate expressions but
not statements, but exec can evaluate either, but always returns
None. My first version, exampleserver.py, requires the user to
prefix statements with ":". My smarter version, 
exampleserver2.py, first tries to evaluate, and if that fails,
then will exec. 

Also, at first I was not giving a "globals()" argument to exec()
so any definitions were not in the global scope. I was having to
go through gymnastics to get persistence. But then further research
revealed the way of getting the execution in the global scope.

This work paves the way for clients, e.g. on ipad, to remotely
control the brickpi3.
